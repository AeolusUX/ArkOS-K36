## Important Announcement: Project Sunset Notice and Archival

As of August 25, 2025, we are announcing that the community-maintained ArkOS project for the K36, R36S Clones, R36Max, U8 Handheld, and RX6H will be **sunset and archived**. With the official and mod release of the K36 on the horizon, this project will no longer receive updates or active support. We want to thank the RetroHandhelds community, contributors, and users for their incredible support and collaboration in making ArkOS a viable solution for these devices.

### What This Means for Users
- **No Further Updates**: The current releases (listed below) will be the final versions of ArkOS for these devices. No new features, bug fixes, or compatibility updates will be provided.
- **Archive Status**: This repository will be archived and maintained as a read-only resource for those who wish to continue using the existing firmware images or fork the project for their own purposes.
- **Existing Downloads**: The firmware images will remain available for download until further notice, but we encourage users to transition to the official K36 release or other supported firmware as they become available.
- **Community Support**: While the RetroHandhelds Discord will remain a valuable resource for general handheld emulation discussions, specific support for this project will no longer be provided. Users are welcome to share knowledge and assist each other informally.
